<h3>What We Do </h3>

	<p>The Ronald W. Reagan Society raises money, builds relationships and organizes programs to support the many ways Eureka College serves as a living legacy for leadership lessons of Ronald Reagan. Membership is open to anyone who shares our belief in the promise of American opportunity. </p>
<a id="campus-sites"></a>
<h4>Reagan Campus Sites</h4>

<p>Ronald Reagan is the only president born, raised and educated in Illinois and Eureka College's campus, located at the end of the "Reagan Trail," is the best place to visit to learn about his college life and his leadership legacy. The Ronald W. Reagan Society invites you to visit the many campus sites related to him where one can still picture him strolling across campus with his TKE fraternity brothers on his way to a class in economics, football practice or perhaps to see his older brother, Neil "Moon" who followed him to Eureka. </p>

<p>You are invited to visit campus to experience Eureka College's Reagan Museum, Reagan Peace Garden, the Mark R. Shenkman Reagan Research Center at the Melick Library (by appointment). Other Reagan-related sites on campus including The Chapel where he made his first speech, McKinzie Field where he played football, or the athletic center his brother and helped donate. Learn more at Reagan Campus Sites by clicking below. </p>
